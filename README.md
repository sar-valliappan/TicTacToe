# Tic Tac Toe (C++) — Minimax

This project is a fully interactive **Tic Tac Toe game written in C++**, featuring:

- A clean, text-based game board  
- Human vs. Human mode  
- Human vs. Computer mode  
- A **perfect opponent** implemented using the **Minimax algorithm**  
- Input validation and error handling  

This was the first program I built while learning C++, and it helped me understand fundamental concepts like arrays, functions, recursion, and algorithmic decision-making.

## Features

### Human vs. Human  
Players take turns entering positions on the board.

### Human vs. Computer  
The computer plays perfectly using **Minimax**, meaning it:

- Never loses  
- Always chooses the optimal move  
- Forces a tie when it cannot win  

### Game Logic  
Includes:

- Win detection  
- Tie detection  
- Board printing with clean formatting  
- Input validation (invalid numbers, non-integer input, etc.)

## Technologies Used

- **C++17**
- Standard library: `<iostream>`, `<random>` (a previous version where the computer played random moves)
